### Wordlists :page_with_curl:

Those who are using hacking linux machine (like kali/parrot os, which has pre-installed stuff), can find password wordlist at `/usr/share/wordlists/` (mostly `rockyou.txt`, if it is `rockyou.txt.gz` - unzip with `tar -xvzf rockyou.txt.gz`)

Download links (password wordlists):
